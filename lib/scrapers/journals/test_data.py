The nuclear spin bath evolution is driven by elementary processes such as single spin precession and pairwise flip flops.

iop_1 = {'title': 'Micromegas at low pressure for beam tracking', 'abstract': u'New facilities like FAIR at GSI or SPIRAL2 at GANIL, will provide radioactive ion beams at low energies (less than 10 MeV/n). Such beams have generally a large emittance, which requires the use of beam tracking detectors to reconstruct the exact trajectories of the nuclei. To avoid the angular and energy straggling that classical beam tracking detectors would generate in the beam due to their thickness, we propose the use of SED (Secondary Electron Detectors). It consists of a low pressure gaseous detector placed outside the beam coupled to an emissive foil in the beam. Since 2008, different low pressure gaseous detectors (wire chambers and micromegas) have been constructed and tested. The performances achievable at low pressure are similar to or even better than the ones at atmospheric pressure. The fast charge collection leads to excellent timing properties as well as high counting rate capabilities. Several micromegas at low pressure were tested in the laboratory demonstrating a good time resolution, 130\xb130 ps, which is compatible with the results obtained with wire chambers.', 'citation': {'volume': '7', 'journal': 'Journal of Instrumentation', 'pub_year': '2012', 'page_first': 'C03017'}, 'ids': {'doi': '10.1088/1748-0221/7/03/C03017'}, 'source_url': 'http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-0221/7/03/C03017', 'author_names': ['Pancin, J', u'Fern\xe1ndez, B', 'Damoy, S', 'Kebbiri, M', 'Papaevangelou, T', 'Riallot, M'], 'journal': 'Journal of Instrumentation'}

pnas_1 = {'title': 'Structural basis for a molecular allosteric control mechanism of cofactor binding to nuclear receptors', 'abstract': u'Transcription regulation by steroid hormones, vitamin derivatives, and metabolites is mediated by nuclear receptors (NRs), which play an important role in ligand-dependent gene expression and human health. NRs function as homodimers or heterodimers and are involved in a combinatorial, coordinated and sequentially orchestrated exchange between coregulators (corepressors, coactivators). The architecture of DNA-bound functional dimers positions the coregulators proteins. We previously demonstrated that retinoic acid (RAR-RXR) and vitamin D3 receptors (VDR-RXR) heterodimers recruit only one coactivator molecule asymmetrically without steric hindrance for the binding of a second cofactor. We now address the problem of homodimers for which the presence of two identical targets enhances the functional importance of the mode of binding. Using structural and biophysical methods and RAR as a model, we could dissect the molecular mechanism of coactivator recruitment to homodimers. Our study reveals an allosteric mechanism whereby binding of a coactivator promotes formation of nonsymmetrical RAR homodimers with a 2\u22361 stoichiometry. Ligand conformation and the cofactor binding site of the unbound receptor are affected through the dimer interface. A similar control mechanism is observed with estrogen receptor (ER) thus validating the negative cooperativity model for an established functional homodimer. Correlation with published data on other NRs confirms the general character of this regulatory pathway.', 'citation': {'volume': '109', 'journal': 'PNAS', 'pub_year': '2012', 'page_first': 'E588', 'page_last': 'E594'}, 'ids': {'doi': '10.1073/pnas.1118192109'}, 'source_url': 'http://www.pnas.org/content/109/10/E588.abstract', 'author_names': ['Judit Osz', u'Yann Br\xe9livet', 'Carole Peluso-Iltis', 'Vincent Cura', 'Sylvia Eiler', 'Marc Ruff', 'William Bourguet', 'Natacha Rochel', 'Dino Moras']}

The long-lived fission products and transuranium elements within damaged fuel remain a concern for millennia. Currently, accurate fundamental models for the prediction of release rates of radionuclides from fuel, especially in contact with water, after an accident remain limited. Relatively little is known about fuel corrosion and radionuclide release under the extreme chemical, radiation, and thermal conditions during and subsequent to a nuclear accident.

Compared to OA, 2.5-fold, 2.3-fold, 2.2-fold, 2.1-fold, and 1.9-fold enhancement of Peff in buffer with pH 6.0 was observed for l-Phe ester (5c), l-Val ester (5a), l-Lys ester (5e), d-Phe ester (5d), and d-Val ester (5b), respectively.

We describe the relativistic physics, noting that a prerequisite for synchronization is the existence of a space-time with a stationary metric. The analysis shows that there are no Special Relativistic effects that need be included in the synchronization method, beyond those in a standard GPS clock. In particular, synchronizing a ground clock to the GPS satellite does not make that clock keep time in the reference frame of the satellite. Symmetries are very helpful in analyzing the behavior.
